    <pre class="content">In the 2nd century BC, a list was compiled of what was then thought to be the Seven Wonders of the World. Today, only one survives - the
Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. Many variations have followed, but when the Swiss New Seven Wonders Foundation launched a new poll a couple of decades ago, 
over 100 million people across the globe voted for their favorites. You won't be surprised to learn, therefore, that such popularity correlates pretty closely 
to visitor numbers. Scheduling a visit to avoid the heaviest crowds while chasing ideal weather takes careful planning. and a bit of luck.
Here's how to work out the best time to visit the New Seven Wonders of the World.</pre>

    <h2 class="subhead">COLLOSSEUM PIAZZA</h2>
    <p class="content">The Colosseum attracts millions of visitors every year and is one of Rome’s most popular sites. That being said, it is also home to
         some of the longest lines in the city. In order to get the most out of your visit to Rome, it is vital that you plan your Colosseum visit in advance.
         Early birds usually have the shortest waiting time but, keep in mind, traveling during peak season means crowds no matter the time of day.The entrance
          fee to the Colosseum also includes a visit to the Roman Forum/Palatine Hill. The Roman Forum and Palatine Hill are technically two different sites but, 
          because they are situated next to each, they are considered one area. This means that the Colosseum ticket can be used twice: one entrance into the Colosseum
           (at the specified reservation time) and one entrance to the Roman Forum/Palatine Hill . Keep in
            mind that the Roman Forum/Palatine Hill is a large area and usually requires at least an hour to explore – so plan your itinerary accordingly.The Colosseum 
            and Roman Forum/Palatine Hill open everyday at 8:30am and the last entrance is about an hour before dusk (see chart below for time schedule). All visitors 
            are allowed to remain in the site one hour after the last entrance. Due to the significant size of the Roman Forum/Palatine Hill, the custodians will direct
             visitors to exit the area early in order to ensure the site can close on time – this can happen even 30 minutes prior to closing time, so be sure to allow 
             plenty of time to visit the site.here are many ways to visit the Colosseum. Every reservation ticket has a timed entrance for the Colosseum so be sure 
             to check your ticket and arrive with plenty of time to spare. Each ticket also includes one entrance to the Roman Forum/Palatine Hill, as stated earlier.
              You can enter the Roman Forum/Palatine Hill on the same day or within 24hrs of the reservation time. Let’s say, for example, you have a 2:00pm entrance
               for the Colosseum. You will need to be at the main entrance of the Colosseum closer to 1:30pm, show your ticket to the Colosseum staff and they will let
                you enter into the security line (you may have to wait until 10 minutes before your reservation time). The Colosseum entrance time is non-negotiable.
                 The Roman Forum/Palatine Hill entrance is up to your discretion. You could use it in three different ways: on the same day but in the morning and 
                 arriving to the Colosseum entrance at 1:30pm; on the same day but after you have finished your visit to the Colosseum and before the last entrance 
                 time for the Forum/Palatine; the following day but entering the Forum/Palatine before the ticket expires at 2:00pm. In addition to the standard ticket
                  option, there are restricted-access tickets available for purchase. These upgraded tickets include access to the Colosseum’s Arena Stage, the
                   Dungeons/Underground level of the Colosseum These VIP areas are accessed via the Stern entrance, commonly referred to as the Gladiator Gate entrance. This separate entrance has much shorter security lines than the main entrance.Arrange your
                    visit instead for the shoulder seasons of spring or autumn, and you'll still be able to take advantage of warm, dry weather. Easter in the Eternal
                     City is hard to beat. You don't have to be a Catholic to be awed by the sight of the tens of thousands of worshippers gathered in St. Peter's Square
                      to hear the Papal address, though you might use it as an excuse to tour the Colosseum while they're otherwise occupied. But if you can stomach the
                       queue, the Colosseum is free to enter on the first Sunday of every month, and on a few other predetermined days each year.</p>

<h2 class="subhead">THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA</h2>
    <p class="content">
        The best time to visit Great Wall of China should be between the spring and autumn, from March to October. The chilly winter is not very recommended.
         In the absence of green plants, the scenery is not as good as in other seasons. However, the snow scenery of the Great Wall is also worth a visit.
         March: -2 – 13C (28 - 55°F); pleasant, cloudy and a little windy
         This month is the first month of spring. The temperature starts to increase day by day and it is very appropriate for hiking on Great Wall to enjoy the renewed scenery. The recommended sections for first-time and regular tourists are Jinshanling and Simatai, which are less steep and dangerous. For those more experienced hikers, Jiankou Great Wall must be the best challenge.
         However, making full preparation is very necessary beforehand because of the awkward terrain.
         The most famous Badaling and Mutianyu: Afternoon
 Compared with other sections, these two sections always receive more visitors. For a better travel experience, it is suggested to travel there in the afternoon.
         June: 18 – 31C (64 - 88°F); hot and sunny, short-time rains
In the first month of summer, it will be a little hot to hike the Great Wall on land like Badaling or Mutianyu. But it is really a good option to visit the Simatai Great Wall. The nearby Gubei Water Town brings down the temperature a little and makes it one of the best sections to visit in summer; also, Simatai is the only section open at night, when the weather is much cooler than daytime.
 Besides that, Huanghuacheng Great Wall is a rare lakeside section. The cool clear water just rescues you from the summer heat. 
 September: 11 – 23C (52 - 73°F); sunny, pleasant and cool
 Generally, the temperature of the suburb area is lower than that of the downtown city, thus it is very cool on the Great Wall in this month. In September, 
 the tree leaves are tinged with autumn color. You can enjoy the best views of Badaling and Mutianyu during this month.Better to Avoid Traveling to Great Wall on Holidays
 Remember to avoid visiting Great Wall on the Chinese public holidays like National Day holiday from October 1 to 7, and May Day holiday. The summer vacation from July to August is also a tourism peak season and the Great Wall is often full of student visitors and their families during this period. If you have to travel in these times, 
 it is suggested to avoid popular Badaling and Mutianyu sections. Best Time of Day to Visit Great Wall of China
 The best time of the day to visit Great Wall of China varies a lot according to various sections. Here lists the best time of some popular sections of Great Wall of China.
  
 
 The most famous Badaling and Mutianyu: Afternoon
 Compared with other sections, these two sections always receive more visitors. For a better travel experience, it is suggested to travel there in the afternoon. It takes about 3 hours for a round trip, and 2-3 hours is needed for the visit. In total, about 5-6 hours are enough on the adventure. So you can depart from downtown at about 10:00 to 11:00, arrive there at noon; after having a simple lunch, start enjoying your hiking. Remember don’t miss the last bus or train back to Beijing city. The last bus back from Badaling is at 16:30, the last train at 17:56 and the last bus from Mutianyu is at 16:50.  
  
 
 Farther Jinshanling and Gubeikou: Morning
 Morning is undoubtedly the best time of a day to visit Jinshanling and Gubeikou Great Wall. The two sections are farther away from the downtown and you have to spend 2.5-3 hours on the bus ride to Jinshanling and 3.5-4 hours to Gubeikou. It takes about 4 hours to hike the full Jinshanling and at least 2 hours the Gubeikou. The distance between Gubeikou and Jinshanling is around 10km and it takes about 5 hours to hike from one to another. So if you want to have a day trip, depart in the morning as early as possible.

Sunrise View Of Taj Mahal
Taj Mahal is opened from sunrise to sunset (6 am to 6.30 pm). While you can visit Taj anytime during the day, going in the morning (during sunrise) is recommended, and here’s why!
Fewer People: In the Sunrise Taj Mahal Tour, there are generally fewer people as compared to afternoon or evening tours.

You can capture the beauty of the Taj Mahal with beautiful sunrise shots.
Taj Mahal Color Changing: During sunrise, with the sun coming up, the Taj Mahal shines with an amber glow and you can actually see the different shades of sunlight on the Taj Mahal’s white marble.

<h2 class="subhead">THE CHRIST REDEEMER</h2>

First things first. If you wonder how much it really costs to visit Christ The Redeemer, the answer is: it depends!

There are many different ways of getting to the Christ, and prices may vary big time depending on the option you choose,There are four main ways of visiting Christ The Redeemer: by van, train, with a tour agency, and hiking.To visit Christ The Redeemer by Train, the first step is getting to the Christ Redeemer Visitor Center located at the address Rua Cosme Velho, 513 – Santa Teresa Rio de Janeiro.

Also, tours include English-speaking guides that will tell you everything about the history of these iconic places and even take you for lunch at a famous ‘churrascaria.’

<h2 class="subhead">MACHU PICCHU</h2>
    <p class="content">
        Machu Picchu is one of the most popular attractions in South America. This UNESCO World Heritage Site attracts more than 2 million visitors each year, and for good reason. It is a spectacular place with a fascinating history, beautiful scenery and many activities.

With so many people visiting Machu Picchu each year, Here are some tips for planning your trip:

The best months to visit Machu Picchu: May to October.

During this time, the weather is usually sunny with clear skies and temperatures range between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius (60-77 F). The rainy season lasts from October to March. During these months, there are frequent showers and thunderstorms that can last for hours. It is also possible to get snow in the higher mountains of Cusco during these months if you are lucky enough to visit the country in early January or late February.
The best time to visit the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu is during the dry season from April to October. For warmer temperatures with light to heavy rains, visit from November to March.

Why?

Keep in mind that Peru is a large country with diverse geographies, including beaches, desert, mountains and rainforest – each with its own climate, flora, fauna and climatic conditions.

This makes it difficult to determine a good time to travel to Peru if you are visiting several places during your trip.
Our best advice is to check the weather conditions at each of your destinations – or ask your friendly Travel Advisor for some advice! – and pack your things accordingly.

Machu Picchu is open 7 days a week, every day of the year, including holidays.

Best time to go
If you want the chance to see one of the Seven Wonders of the World as seen in the classic photographs – clear blue skies as a backdrop of sunlit stone ruins nestled amidst granite peaks covered by the jungle.

Your best chance during the dry season between May and October. Keep in mind, however, that even during the dry season, there can be mornings and evenings with strong mists that can obscure the views.

Rear our blog: How to get to Machu Picchu.

The warmest climate
For a tour to Machu Picchu, the warmest weather is from November to March. But this also corresponds to the rainy season. In other words, higher temperatures do not correlate with good weather in Machu Picchu.

The peak season is from June to August.
The peak travel season for tourists from all over the world and from all over Peru who arrive in Machu Picchu is from June to August. During this time, large crowds can make it a bit difficult to move around some parts of the Sanctuary and long queues at the entrance to the ruins are common.

June through August is also a popular time for travelers who choose the most difficult and exciting way to get to Machu Picchu by the Inca Trail.

The rainy season
Rain from light drizzles to heavy rains occurs almost every day from November to March. The strongest rain is in February, which is also when the Inca Trail trail is closed for maintenance.

The flowering season begins in October/November and continues until March.

The dry season
In general, we believe that the best time to visit Machu Picchu is from April to October. Again, rain and fog is possible at any time of year because Machu Picchu is located on the edge of the rainforest. But during the “dry season”, you have the best chance of appreciating all the beauty of the ruins.

Machu Picchu Weather By Month
Machu Picchu In January
The climate in Machu Picchu in January and in the Andean mountains of Cusco is rainy. Historically it has been a month of mudslides on the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. Rain may not be advisable for hiking, but you can still go by train.

<h2 class="subhead">CHICHEN ITZA</h2>
    <p class="content">
        hichén Itz is a large Maya city ruin in Mexico, located in the state of Oaxaca. In the months of November through April, the driest and least crowded times to visit are ideal. The most well-known of the objects is the El Castillo Temple (Temple of Kukulkan). This pyramid is exceptional because it demonstrates the accuracy of Maya astronomy.

        Chichén Itz takes about three hours on average to see. Depending on your sightseeing style (e.g., if you just want to see the sights and learn about the history of each feature), it could take anywhere from 2-4 hours.
        From November to March, the weather in Yucatn, Mexico, is ideal. The summer months can be humid, and the rainy season can begin after June, making a tour of the ancient city miserable and wet. Visiting Chichen Itza in the fall will make you less likely to run into large crowds.

        Chichen Itza is best visited in the months of November 12th to May 13th if the weather is ideal. When the weather is warm in the early to mid May, it is usually early to mid May, when highs reach around 98.8F (35.1C) at night. The months with the least chances of significant precipitation are April, March, and December. Throughout the year, it can be extremely humid in Chichen Itza, and there are several extremely humid months. In May, the average wind speed was around 4.5 knots (5.1 MPH or 8.6 KPH), making it a light breeze. Maximum sustained winds (the highest speeds for the day lasting more than a few minutes) are common in the early to mid-April. The busiest month for tourism is in January, followed by February and March.
        
        The graph depicts the services used by tourists during the first six months of the year that were identified through Google searches. In the June-August months, Chichen Itza’s tourism season is relatively slow, which means lodging and other accommodations may be a little less expensive. During the middle of the year, there is a very pleasant climate, with temperatures that are quite warm.
        In the morning or late at night, the best times to visit Chichen Itza are when the number of tourists is significantly lower.
        Chichen Itza can get busy at any time of day, but the busiest time is usually around midday. This is when the sun is at its highest point in the sky and the heat can be intense. If you want to avoid the crowds, the best time to visit is early in the morning or late in the afternoon.
        Crowds at Chichen Itza can be difficult to manage, but these tips will help you avoid them: When you arrive early, the ruins will be less crowded; when you arrive late, the ruins will be even more crowded.
The off-season is an excellent time to visit. During the summer and into Christmas, Chichen Itza is always busy, but the site is always open.
Avoid weekends if possible: Maintain a regular schedule. On weekends, Chichen Itza is the most popular tourist destination, with more groups visiting simultaneously.
Even though the ruins are a dry place in the day, there is a chance they will rain during the day.
Bring a hat and sunglasses to protect your face from the sun.
Bring your own water because there is no drinking water at the ruins.
The following tips will assist you in making the most of your visit to Chichen Itza while avoiding the crowds.It is strongly advised that visitors reserve their tickets in advance, but even if they do not, they are welcome to visit the ruins. There are clearly marked areas where people are not permitted, and there are also designated areas where you are not permitted. Visitors who are uncomfortable or feel unsafe should leave the site and look for another. Itza is an ideal location to enjoy a vacation in the Riviera Maya.

<h2 class="subhead">PETRA JORDAN</h2>
    <p class="content">
        Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan.
        visit Petra during summertime, we do not recommend it at all. We believe the best months to visit Petra are during spring and autumn.

        If you visit Petra in the months of summer, you will suffer not just the 35º/40º degrees, but also a lot of tourists. Summer is for us the worst time to visit Petra.  In wintertime it will be really cold and during Christmas you will also see a lot of tourists.
        
        
        Meanwhile, if you decide to go in spring or autumn the temperatures are between 17º and 25º which is nice. Definitely that´s the best time to visit Petra.
        
        Next you will find how is visiting Petra month by month:
        
        Visiting Petra in December, January and February
        If you decide to visit Petra in these months be well prepared with a big coat as the weather in Petra in January is the coldest of the whole year. If you are lucky you may find it with snow! It´s also the wettest season of the year.
        
        A visit to Petra in May, April or March
        It´s one of the best times to travel to Petra. It stops being cold (chilly at night) and everything starts getting more lush and green, which is beautiful. The only problem is that many people like to visit Petra during these months. But it´s still worth it.
        
        Visiting Petra in June, July and August
        best-time-to-visit-Petra
        
        As we said, for us these are the worst times to visit Petra. The wonder of the world is still getting a lot of tourists compared to other seasons, and the temperatures during summer in Petra are crazy. Jordan in July and August are extremely hot, it´s awful.
        
        Visit Petra in September, October and November
        By far this is for us the best time to visit Petra. Tourists are gone as in many places September is when people go back to work after vacations. Plus, the temperatures go down a little bit and is not as dry as the summer season.
        
        Best time of day to visit Petra
       
        
        On another note, you should also choose at what time of the day do you want to go to Petra as there are many options. You can decide to stay the whole day there from sunrise to sunset or even stay until night, but it may be a little bit painful. These are the best times of the day to visit Petra:
        
        Wake up for sunrise in Petra
        We know it´s hard to wake up at 05:00 in the morning, but sometimes it´s worth it. Of course, Petra is one of those cases. The sunrise in Petra is at 6Am, and that´s actually the same time they open the gates. As soon as you get inside skip the rest of the places and go to either the monastery or the treasure of Petra… you will have it all for yourself! If that´s not the best time to go to Petra, we don´t know what is.
        
        Golden hour and sunset in Petra
        Sunset-in-Petra
        
        Another really good option in case you couldn´t make it for sunrise is to go at sunset time. Of course, in a sunset in Petra you won’t have the advantage of having the place empty for yourself, but the colours on the sky will be worth it. The sunsets in Petra are nice but it´s important that you don´t miss the golden hour, as it´s at that time when the treasure has the best light and the red tone.
        
        Petra by night is worth it
        Those were the best times to visit Petra during the day, but what many people don´t know is that you can also go at night. Seeing Petra by night is totally worth it, as there is also a light show and the famous architecture gets outstanding.
        
        Enjoy visiting Petra!!
        Although we recommend you check out the weather in Petra and Jordan, always keep in mind that no matter when you go to Petra, you will love it!
