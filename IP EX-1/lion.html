        <h3>FEATURES:</h3>
        <ul style="font-family: century gothic;font-size: 18px">
            <li>Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride.</li>
            <li>In some lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance.</li>
            <li>Lions proclaim their territory by roaring and by scent marking.</li>
            <li>Their distinctive roar is generally delivered in the evening before a nightâ€™s hunting and again before getting up at dawn.</li>
            <li>Lions prey on a large variety of animals ranging in size from rodents 
                     and baboons to Cape (or African) buffalo and hippopotamuses,
                     but they predominantly hunt medium- to large-sized hoofed animals 
                     such as wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes.</li>
